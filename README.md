# Module 2 Coding Assignment

## Responsive Restaurant Menu

This project is my submission for Module 2 of the Coursera course [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers).

### Overview

This responsive web page features a restaurant menu with three food categories (Chicken, Beef, and Sushi). The implementation meets all the assignment requirements:

- **Single-page responsive design** that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- **External CSS styling** with no frameworks or inline styles
- **Section titles** consistently positioned in the top-right corner
- **Proper spacing and borders** throughout the layout

### Responsive Breakpoints

The page implements three distinct layouts:

- **Desktop View (≥992px)**: Three equal columns in a single row
- **Tablet View (768px-991px)**: Two columns in first row, one column in second row
- **Mobile View (≤767px)**: Single column layout with each section stacked vertically

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)
- Git/GitHub (for version control and hosting)

### Implementation Notes

- Used the box-sizing: border-box model for consistent sizing
- Implemented floating elements for the layout with proper clearfix
- Created unique styling for each menu section while maintaining visual consistency
- Ensured proper text and element spacing throughout different viewport sizes
