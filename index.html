                    Our chicken dishes are prepared with the finest free-range poultry. Each entr√©e is marinated for 24 hours in our signature blend of herbs and spices before being slow-cooked to perfection. Our most popular chicken options include the herb-roasted chicken with rosemary potatoes, the spicy chicken curry served with basmati rice, and our classic chicken parmesan with homemade marinara sauce.
